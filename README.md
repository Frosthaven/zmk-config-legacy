### SAMURAI FROM ACCOUNTING (SFA) ZMK KEYMAP

This is a bluetooth-enabled [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) configuration for the [Corne keyboard (aka crkbd; helidox)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), powered by the [nice!nano](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/nice-nano#:~:text=The%20nice!,battery%20is%20a%20good%20fit.) (or compatible) microprocessors. Code and chat by day, slay demons at night!

### WHO IS IT FOR?

This is a personal keymap, with a focus on being familiar to both gamers and developers. Key highlights:
* WASD+QE navigation cluster that will be familiar to anyone who's played an fps
* Numpad cluster with expected layout and all finance-related symbology
* Symbol pad with carefully arranged symbols for quick access
* Function pad with native F13-F15 to use as you wish

### TODO

* OLED (battery/bluetooth status):
  * awaiting feature documentation in ZMK
* RGB underglow support:
  * need to research creating a board overlay
* Per-key RGB:
  * awaiting feature completion and documentation in ZMK
