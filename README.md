### SAMURAI FROM ACCOUNTING (SFA) ZMK KEYMAP

This is a bluetooth-enabled [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) configuration for the [Corne keyboard (aka crkbd; helidox)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), powered by the [nice!nano](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/products/nice-nano#:~:text=The%20nice!,battery%20is%20a%20good%20fit.) (or compatible) microprocessors.

### WHO IS IT FOR?

This is my personal keymap with a focus on easy symbols for coding with a gaming-oriented wasd navigation cluster design.

### TODO

* OLED (battery/bluetooth status):
  * awaiting feature documentation in ZMK
* RGB underglow support:
  * need to research creating a board overlay
* Per-key RGB:
  * awaiting feature completion and documentation in ZMK
